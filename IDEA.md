I plan to build a website like below:
- This will be like Omegle but specialized in IELTS speaking practice, it like "Tandem" app but that app is for everyday life speaking and communication, but my app will focus on english certification practice
- User will randomly matching with another person then start chatting or video calling
- Before they start randomly matching people, they will have to choose:
  + How many question they want to practice
  + The categories (topic, test styles) they want to talk about (from a filter checkboxes)
   + Their score band
- When they started calling, a topic card will pop up to show the topic to talk about, things will goes like turn-based game, the two person in the call will have a question card in their turn, and they will answer, each user will have 3 or 5 round
- After they complete their practice, at the end of the call, a form will be popup and that form will be create by our team to guide user to cross valuate score band for their opponent, the score will be show to the users and then store in system that they can check later
- Users can choose to public their speaking part in the feed of our website/app or not, if yes a video will be store and then public, other users in the app can rate that speaking, leave score band and explain the score they give
- User will need credit to call or chat, and they will get credit through export their speaking video and rate other speaking on the feed (we will have criteria for a good rating)
